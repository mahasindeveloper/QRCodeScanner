  <h1>QR Code Scanner Description</h1>
  <p>A QR Code scanner is a technology that enables users to scan Quick Response (QR) codes, which are two-dimensional barcodes containing information such as text, URLs, contact information, or other data. The scanner uses a device's camera to read the QR code and decode the embedded information.</p>

  <h2>How QR Code Scanners Work:</h2>
  <ol>
    <li><strong>Scanning Process:</strong> Users open a QR Code scanner app or use a device's built-in scanning feature. The camera captures the QR code's image.</li>
    <li><strong>Decoding Information:</strong> The scanner software processes the image, decodes the QR code, and extracts the embedded data.</li>
    <li><strong>Action or Display:</strong> Depending on the content of the QR code (such as a website link, text, or contact information), the scanner either redirects users to a website, displays text information, saves contact details, or performs the appropriate action related to the encoded data.</li>
  </ol>

  <p>QR Code scanners are commonly found in various apps for smartphones, tablets, and other devices. They have numerous applications across industries:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Marketing and Advertising:</strong> QR codes are used in marketing campaigns to direct users to websites, promotions, or exclusive content.</li>
    <li><strong>Payment Systems:</strong> Some QR codes contain payment information, allowing users to make transactions by scanning the code.</li>
    <li><strong>Inventory Management:</strong> In warehouses or stores, QR codes can be used for tracking and managing inventory.</li>
    <li><strong>Authentication and Security:</strong> QR codes can facilitate two-factor authentication or provide secure access to information.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>These scanners have become an integral part of modern technology, offering a convenient way to quickly access information or perform various tasks by simply scanning a code with a compatible device.</p>
